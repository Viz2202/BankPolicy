# BankPolicy
This is just a simple project which showcases the use of logistic regression for detemining whether a bank policy will be accepted by a person or not using the information asked the dataset used was (UCI dataset of Portugese Bank)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityamhaske/bank-marketing-dataset/data] which was divided into an 80-20 train test divide and gave 88.7% accuracy.
Further a frontend was also added using Python Flask, then it was dockerized and then deployed on (Render)[https://render.com/] then (Uptime robot)[https://uptimerobot.com/] was used to prevent the website from being inactive.
This was my first experience with all this and had lots of fun.
